# Snake_Game

Snake Game is a classic game where snake keeps growing as it eats food and the snake can be controlled by the arrow keys.
I have created a table in MySQL using the following code :

CREATE TABLE HIGH_SCORE
(SCORE INT(50));

This table will store the high scores.

I have used the MySQL-Connector-Python to connect to the database.
To install it using the following code : pip install mysql-connector-python
